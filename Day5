How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
1. Tech Experts:

    Use of Jargon and Technical Terms: For an audience of tech experts, you can use industry-specific jargon, technical terminology, and abbreviations that they are familiar with. You don’t need to explain basic concepts because they have the background to understand advanced topics.
    Depth of Detail: You can delve deeper into technical details, providing more intricate explanations, algorithms, code snippets, and system architectures.
    Efficiency in Communication: Experts typically value concise and direct explanations. They may prefer overviews and summaries that cut straight to the technical details without extra context or background information.
    Assumed Knowledge: Since they already have a strong foundation, you can skip basic definitions or introductory explanations and focus on the higher-level aspects or cutting-edge advancements.

2. Regular Folks (Non-Experts):

    Simplified Language: For a non-expert audience, you should avoid heavy technical jargon. Use simpler language and provide clear explanations of any technical terms or acronyms that might be unfamiliar to them.
    Contextualization and Analogies: It helps to break down complex concepts into familiar terms or use analogies to explain technical ideas in a way that connects to everyday experiences.
    Step-by-Step Instructions: Use visual aids like diagrams, screenshots, or flowcharts, and consider breaking down instructions into easy-to-follow steps. This makes the material more accessible to those who don’t have a technical background.
    High-Level Overview: Focus on the big picture and the practical benefits or outcomes of the technology rather than deep technical details. Help them understand why something matters, rather than how it works at a technical level.
